% Note on notation/ convention:

% In all cases...

% S points correspond to E points
% T points correspond to H points

% antiSymS =     PEC ending on an E point
% symS =         PMC ending on an E point
% antiSymT =     PMC ending on an H point
% symT =         PEC ending on an H point



% We could define the following as well, 
% but currently DO NOT consider this case:

% S points correspond to H points
% T points correspond to E points

% antiSymS =     PMC ending on an H point
% symS =         PEC ending on an H point
% antiSymT =     PEC ending on an E point
% symT =         PMC ending on an E point
